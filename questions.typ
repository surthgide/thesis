== Exact solutions with AdS asymptotics of Einstein and Einstein-Maxwell gravity minimally coupled to a scalar field

+ domain wall? conformal Lifshitz?
+ AdS length? line element calculated from metric or something else? radius of AdS poincar√© disk?
+ designer gravity?
 
== A solution-generating method in Einstein-scalar gravity

+ horn/flux tube type solutions?

== Sine-Gordon solitonic scalar stars and black holes

+ compactness? how is it defined?

== Scalar stars and lumps with (A)dS core

+ super-plankian emissions?
+ Nariai spacetime? did i understand correctly that it is the interpolation solution between a Schwarzschild black hole and a dS spacetime?
+ why must U(0) = 1? does this lead to the singularity's smearing or is it just to ensure the vanishing at infinity?

== Derivative computation

i managed to calculate the derivative of U(x), obtaining a single value for the stationary point: i thought i had to find multiple, but the equation for the solution is linear

== Thesis text

+ definition and explanation of gravastars
+ brief analysis of the solutions presented on the paper
+ reason for new theorem
+ steps to derive stationary point
+ ???
