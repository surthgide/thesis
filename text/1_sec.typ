= General relativity

The framework of general relativity will be used throughout this thesis as a basis to expand onto.

== Mathematical background

The main building blocks behind that compose the mathematical basis of general relativity are the language of tensors and the riemannian geometry, the latter being the sydy of differential manifolds equipped with a riemannian metric.

=== Tensors in general relativity

In general, a tensor is a multi-linear map between vector spaces or, alternatively, as a function that transforms under a change of coordinates in the following way

$ (T')^(a_1 a_2 dots.h a_n)_(b_1 b_2 dots.h b_n) = ( (partial x'^(a_1))/(partial x^(c_1)) (partial x'^(a_2))/(partial x^(c_2)) dots.h (partial x'^(a_n))/(partial x^(c_n)) ) ( (partial x^(d_1))/(partial x'^(b_1)) (partial x^(d_2))/(partial x'^(b_2)) dots.h (partial x^(d_n))/(partial x'^(b_n)) ) T^(b_1 b_2 dots.h b_n)_(d_1 d_2 dots.h d_n) $

where $T$ is a $n$-th contravariant and $m$-th covarant tensor, and $x^a$ are the cordinates of the manifold.
